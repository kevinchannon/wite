            0.14.1 - Fix issue with bad includes in wite/io.hpp
            0.14.0 - collections::static_vector now holds its items as std::optional values. This means that the items do not get default-constructed when the vector is instanciated, which is generally preferable. There is a side-effect that static_vector::data() would now not do the expected thing, so it's been removed. If you know what you're doing and you want a pointer to the array of optionals, then you can now use the static_vector::ptr() method instead.
